Hello, I'm a researcher and analyst in the domain of data science. My previous research has predominantly centered around predictive modeling and inferential statistics. I have been applying these frameworks and methodologies to the fields that pique my interest. For the past few years, one of these areas has been sports analytics. As an avid sports fan, I have focused on discovering underappreciated athletes by employing regression models and Data Envelopment Analysis. While my past research has primarily focused on sports analytics, I'm also open to exploring any other topics that resonate with my interests and could positively impact our community.
