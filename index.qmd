Hello, I’m a researcher and an analyst in the domain of data science. My previous research has predominantly centered around predictive modeling and deriving insights through statistical analysis. I have been applying these frameworks and methodologies to the fields that pique my interest. While I have worked in the domains of cancer research and sports analytics over the past few years, I’m also open to other topics that resonate with my interests and could positively impact our community.
