Hello, my legal name does not have the letter 'e' at the end, but I prefer to write my name as JeongJune. I'm a researcher in the domain of data science. I started studying data science at the University of Washington for my Bachelor's degree, and I'm currently a master's student in the statistics department at the University of Pittsburgh.
