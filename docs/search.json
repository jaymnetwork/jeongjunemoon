    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe term “hot hand” is a belief originated in basketball that a streak of success temporarily increases the chance of making the next shot. Commentators and fans use such phrases on an athlete who keeps making consecutive shots during the broadcast and also describe that the player is “on fire.” This widespread perception was, however, disproved in 1985 by psychologists Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone, and Amos Tversky. Gilovich et al. demonstrated that the phenomenon is, in fact, a cognitive illusion by random sequence. For instance, when a person flips a coin ten times, there is a chance of having eight consecutive heads. Nevertheless, it is difficult to conclude that the previous seven heads increased the chance of getting a final head in the last attempt. Thus, Gilovich et al. provided that there is no sufficient evidence for a correlation between successive shots and the chance of making the next shot. Studies have continued to follow up and revived the hot-hand debate in academia. Kostas Pelechrinis, an associate professor of computing and information at Pitt’s School of Computing and Information, claimed that Hot hand exists and “players can indeed get hot in actual live-game situations.” This project aims to empirically analyze whether the hot hand exists in the latest NBA season (22-23). The data from modern-era basketball provides a large sample size and better quality in terms of specificity relative to the data used in 1985 by Gilovich et al. Thus, this project expects a better outcome and interpretation of hot hand with a modern dataset of shooting records of renowned NBA players. If the hot hand exists, a coach would be able to know which player should shoot in the last minute of the game when the game is tied. Furthermore, this Hot hand is an interesting theory since it does not only apply to basketball. If the hot hand is not valid, a gambler who keeps winning the game at a casino should know that he will be able to lose all his money in his next bet."

    "title": "Does Hot Hand exist?",
    "section": "Player’s Preference",
    "text": "Player’s Preference\nPrior to testing the hot hand hypothesis, we analyzed each player’s shot preference. Shot preference indicates where in the court the player prefers to shoot. Many studies have been related to shot locations with the hot hand. Lantis et al. state that “difference in shot location from the previous shot also grows in magnitude for longer streaks of success.” We can also make further claims with the result of a hot hand and shot preferences. For instance, if a player is likely to shoot near the post and is identified to have a hot hand, we can also further investigate more players who tend to shoot from similar locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the shot position data for 4 players:\n\nggarrange(l_doncic, d_lillard, d_mitchell, j_embiid, heights = c(0.7, 0.7, 1, 1),\n          ncol = 2, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\nUsing the heatmap, we classified the player’s preferred shot locations. For Damian Lillard, the 3-point line and the area under the basket was the most frequent zone for him to shoot. While Donovan Mitchell had a similar pattern with Lillard, on the contrary, Joel Embiid mainly shot from the basket area. Luka Doncic also attempted his shots in the paint area and behind the arc but seemed to have a tendency in the left midrange as well, with the heat stretching more from the basket.\nBesides the shot preference, shot types are relevant to the hot hand and can also be a proxy variable for shot difficulty (Bocskocsky et al., 2014). There are various types of shots in basketball: Driving lay-ups, pull-up jump shots, step-back jump shots, etc. We analyzed the most frequent types of shots attempted by each player.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggarrange(doncic, lillard, mitchell, embiid, heights = c(0.7, 0.7, 1, 1),\n          ncol = 2, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, Damian Lillard and Donovan Mitchell had the same pattern by having the same four types of shots as their most frequent shot types: Pull-up jump shot, jump shot, driving lay-up, and step-back jump shots. On the other hand, Luka Doncic tends to shoot more step-back jump shots and driving-floating jump shots, while Joel Embiid’s shots mostly consist of jump shots, pull-up jump shots, driving lay-up, and fade-away jump shots."

    "section": "Streaks and Subsequent Shot Attempt",
    "text": "Streaks and Subsequent Shot Attempt\nTo roughly see how the consecutive shooting streaks impact the next shot, we calculated the probability of making the next shot based on the previous shooting streak. The fluctuation of the line plot will not prove the existence of the hot hand. However, if the hot hand exists, we expect the players to have an increase in their field goal percentage compared to the as they keep making the shots successively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggarrange(sb_doncic, sb_lillard, sb_mitchell, sb_embiid, heights = c(0.7, 0.7, 1, 1),\n          ncol = 2, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\nThe result from the last plot does not illustrate sufficient evidence to conclude that hot hands exist during the game of basketball. However, it gives reasonable and valid evidence to dive into a deeper analysis of the selected players.\nThe player who seemed to have a significant increase in slope was Donovan Mitchell. Doncic also had a similar pattern with moderate increase but slightly decreased during the 4 and 5 streak span. Embiid had an incline of the increase until five consecutive field goals but finished with a roughly horizontal slope. On the other hand, Damian Lillard only had the increase until three and also went through a decrease after five streaks."

    "section": "Modeling: Variables",
    "text": "Modeling: Variables\nTo test the hypothesis of Hot Hand, we built a model that can represent the original definition of Hot Hand. For this model, we used the variables below:\n\nResponse Variable: whether the player made a shot or not.\nthe previous streak of success before attempting the current shot.\nLast 4 shot percentage of a player.\nThe entire shot percentage before taking a new shot.\n\nAs the definition of a Hot Hand is previous successive shots increasing the chance of making the current shot, we created the isShotMadeBinary, indicating whether the player made the attempted shot for our response variable. The code below converts true or false values from isShotMade to 1s and 0s. Then, by using the isShotMadeBinary, we cumulated the successive field goals made as a streak, which is the most crucial term in the definition.\n\n\n\nThe reason why we used the last 4 field goal attempts were because the 1st quantile of players in the league take 4 shots during the entire game. At the same time, players generally need to take at least 4 shots to heat up and eventually have a Hot Hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the contemporary era enables us to measure new types of variables, we also included modern features that could indicate information about a player’s shot. The additional predictors used in the full model are listed below:\n\nDistance of a shot\nName of a zone on the court\nType of a shot\nThe exact location of a shot\n\n\n# Formula for each model\nform_def <- as.formula(as.factor(isShotMadeBinary) ~ streaks+lastFour+lastPercentage)\nform_full <- as.formula(as.factor(isShotMadeBinary) ~ typeAction+zoneBasic+locationX+locationY+streaks+lastFour+lastPercentage+distanceShot)\n\nWe used Logistic Regression and Random Forest machine learning algorithms for each model. Thus, as there are four player datasets, we had 16 results at the end."

    "text": "Model Inference\n\nVariable Importance\nOne of the advantages of Random Forest algorithms is that we can visualize the importance of variables used in the model when predicting the response variable. For all four players, the five most important variables when forecasting were the X and Y coordinates of a location, last percentage, shot distance, and the type of shot. Except for the previous percentage, the other four variables are more related to where the player is shooting. For example, types of shots such as dunk or layup shots are attempts that can only be performed near the basket and can not be from behind the 3-point arc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggarrange(ldoncic,dlillard,dmitchell, jembiid, heights = c(0.7, 0.7, 1, 1),\n          ncol = 2, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression Summary\nFor inference in Logistic Regression, we had to eliminate the two categorical values from the full model due to a multicollinearity. The final variables below all had the VIFs lower than 10.\n\n# VIF\nmodel<-(lm(isShotMadeBinary ~ locationX+locationY+streaks+lastFour+lastPercentage+distanceShot, lillard_shots3))\nvif(model)\n\n     locationX      locationY        streaks       lastFour lastPercentage \n      1.010668       6.365743       1.641844       2.492604       1.823214 \n  distanceShot \n      6.349815 \n\n\nFrom the summary results, all four variables used in the definition had high p-values. However, distanceShot variable was statistically significant for all four players. Note that as the coefficient is negative, we recognized that as a player shoots further to the basket, the player is likely to miss the shot, i.e., if a player gets closer shot, the player will have a higher chance of making the shot.\n\n# Logistic Regression Model\nlogistic_model <- function(data){\n  glm(as.factor(isShotMadeBinary) ~ locationX+locationY+streaks+lastFour+lastPercentage+distanceShot, data = data, family = \"binomial\")}\n \n# Summary for each player\nsummary(logistic_model(lillard_shots3))\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = as.factor(isShotMadeBinary) ~ locationX + locationY + \n    streaks + lastFour + lastPercentage + distanceShot, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

    "text": "Discussion\nOverall, we found evidence that Hot Hand may be an illusion based on the data. It turned out that the distance and location were statistically significant for both predicting and inference perspectives. If a player on the court seems to be having a Hot Hand, this might be due to the distance and not the streak of success. Therefore, it may not be an ideal strategy for a coach to solely rely on a “hot-hand” player to take the final shot when the game is tied in the closing seconds.\nHot hand, however, is a complicated concept. While many statisticians have been claiming that the hot hand is a fallacy, the hot hand is not completely under the statistics domain. Shooting in a streak involves various factors, such as muscle memory and psychological factors, that have not yet been measured during the basketball game. Therefore, further studies should be made based on a number of different factors that could newly conceptualize the features when a player is making a shot attempt, as well as utilizing cutting-edge methodologies."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nData is evolving, and so is data in sports. For basketball, it began with basic metrics gleaned from the box score: points, rebounds, assists, and etc. Over time, these traditional statistics transformed into advanced metrics like Player Efficiency Rating and Win Shares. Now, in the contemporary era of basketball, data is being measured and quantified with cutting-edge technologies such as wearables and video cameras.\nIn contemporary basketball analytics, one of the powerful dataset is play-by-play (PBP) data. Compared to boxscore statistics, PBP data provides richer descriptions of the plays that occurred during the game (Vračar et al., 2016). This detailed resource captures every play along with its corresponding time during a basketball game. PBP data is accessible for leagues like the NBA, WNBA, and NCAA. However, when it comes to the Korean Basketball League (KBL), only box score data is currently available on the KBL website.\nWhile replicating the high-quality PBP data of leagues like the NBA, WNBA, and NCAA for the KBL can be challenging, there are still alternative methods to compile such data. One approach involves utilizing web scraping techniques(i.e., Selenium) to extract information from real-time text updates provided by KBL and platforms like ‘NAVER.’ These updates via text offer descriptions of plays, which allow us to have a rudimentary form of PBP data for further analysis and study after cleansing. By using such form of data, the project aims to demonstrate the types of analysis that can be conducted in the KBL."

    "section": "Game Excitement Index & Win Probability",
    "text": "Game Excitement Index & Win Probability\nPBP data opens up numerous possibilities for analysis and insights. One intriguing concepts is the Game Excitement Index (GEI) introduced by Luke Benz. GEI seeks to conceptualize how the excitement level of a game after the game has ended. Benz explains that “It’s a predictive metric, attempting to forecast how exciting a game might be.” This metric can be useful for fans as it can guide which games to re-watch from a large number of past games throughout the season. While it can vary by games and league, following formula shows how GEI can typically be computed:\n\\[\n\\Large{GEI = \\frac{2400}{T} \\sum_{i=2}^{n} |p_i - p_{i-1}|}\n\\]\n\\(T\\) in the formula denotes the time remaining in the game with 2400 being the total duration. \\(n\\) represents the number of plays executed, and \\(p_i\\) is the winning probability of home team on \\(i\\)th play of the game. To estimate the winning probability, Benz utilized a Logistic Regression algorithm, incorporating variables such as score difference and time remaining for prediction. While he included the pre-game point spread in the model, the sports betting related variables in this project was excluded due to personal reasons and limited time.\nThe training data for this project’s model spanned from October 23, 2023, to March 14, 2024, encompassing a total of 165,266 plays in the dataset. To test the model, games scheduled after March 14, 2024, were utilized for the prediction.\nIn-game win probability analysis holds valuable insights not only for spectators but also for coaches and players as it is important to acknowledge the potential impact of underlying factors that led to the turning point of a game. Such analysis can enable them to make strategic adjustments and informed decisions during the game-play. Analyzing the win probability chart provided above and below, the probability lines allow us to pinpoint the moment when LG began to reverse the game’s momentum and increase their chances of winning. On March 22th, JaeDo Lee emerged as a top scorer for LG scoring 13 of his 20 points in the 3rd quarter on the road. To put his 13 points into perspective, this is roughly equivalent to overturning KCC’s 94.8% winning percentage.\nIn a similar vein, Robberechts et al. articulate how the calculation of win probability provides a quantifiable measure of performance under mental pressure. These pivotal moments, often termed ‘clutch’ plays, can be conceptualized by the difference in win probability before and after their occurrence. Therefore, win probability models can function as a tool for assessing in-game decision-making processes and quantifying the balance between risk and reward in coaching decisions (Robberechts et al., 2019).\n\nkbl_wp_chart_new(data=pbp_test, training_data=pbp2, algorithm=\"Logistic Regression\", show_labels = T)\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization function for win probability heavily relies on the ‘ncaahoopR’ package by Benz. Meanwhile, this project explored four algorithms—Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Neural Network—to to compare and analyze prediction patterns and variances. The four models in this project were straightforward, comprising the variables of whether a play was made by the home or away team, score difference, and time remaining in seconds.\n\ngrid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nThe predictions of three algorithms—Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network—predicted similar patterns. The notable point is that the three models predicted approximately 50% win probability prior to the game. In fact, they slightly exceeded this threshold indicating the team tends to win more if they have home advantage.\nThe Random Forest model, on the other hand, showed a relatively higher variability and a less detailed trend line compared to the other three models. As a result of this increased variability, the GEI of the Random Forest model was the highest among the four models. Above all, the probability of reaching 100% before the game ends is logically flawed to some extent. These outcomes indicate that this particular model may require additional adjustments.\nThere still remains a potential to amplify these models by including additional variables, such as the team’s shooting percentage over the last 4 to 5 shots or the streaks of consecutive shots made by the team. We can also refine the pre-game win probability by considering factors such as the team’s schedule, including back-to-back games, and their recent performance over the last few games."

    "text": "Assist Network Analysis\nAnother intriguing application for play-by-play data is assist network analysis. Network analysis can be used to decompose the sophisticated aspect of player’s team work and their contribution to a team’s interactive plays (Korte et al., 2018). This is known to be vital in the analysis of team sports (Vilar et al., 2013; Korte et al., 2018). In basketball, network analysis can visualize the connections between players based on assist frequency. Although assist network is also presented in the package by Benz, a new iteration had to be developed due to data incompatibility. At the same time, the main objective of this visualization was to enhance readability. As the data spans an entire season, it can become challenging to interpret, potentially reducing its usefulness for stakeholders.\n\nkbl_assist_net(data=pbp2, team_select=\"서울 삼성\", random=14, top=13, \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot illustrates an assist network analysis for the major eight players of Seoul Samsung (서울 삼성) from October 22, 2023, to March 14, 2024. It’s evident Junghyun Lee(이정현) was a player who contributed the most by assists. Lee, who ranks at third in average assists in the league, contributed 176 points to Kofi Cockburn(코피 코번)’s total, who currently ranks at third in most points averaged in the KBL. Thus, teams preparing to play against Seoul Samsung should prioritize awareness of Cockburn’s movements whenever Lee has the possession of the ball. However, Sirae Kim (김시래) had the highest assist frequency, at 38.46%. This suggests that Kim’s assists are distributed across multiple players rather than being dependent on any particular individuals.\nWe can also observe that Cockburn emerges as an all-around player within the network, contributing to 23.08% of Samsung’s assists. While Cockburn may not excel in Samsung’s defense, this network analysis mathematically prove that he is currently an irreplaceable and invaluable player for Seoul Samsung."

Sports platforms like ESPN has already implemented a winning probability chart on their website, enabling fans to interact with the data and understand how each play impacts the game’s outcome. Likewise, assist network analysis provides practical insights not only for players and coaches in game preparation but also for fans to grasp the dynamics of passing distribution among players. This project manifests the value of such insights, as seen in leagues like the NBA, WNBA, and NCAA. Therefore, we anticipate that the KBL and other Korean sports industries will also adopt similar analyses using play-by-play data, thereby enriching fan engagement with compelling insights into the game."
