    "text": "Hello, I’m a researcher and analyst in the domain of data science. My previous research interests has predominantly centered around predictive modeling and inferential statistics. I have been applying these frameworks and methodologies to the fields that pique my interest. For the past few years, one of these areas has been sports analytics. As an avid sports fan, I have focused on discovering underappreciated athletes by employing regression models and Data Envelopment Analysis. Although my past research has primarily focused on sports analytics, I’m also open to exploring any other topics that resonate with my interests and could positively impact our community."

While the discipline of Data Science has been growing in the sports industry, my focus has been extracting insights from the information to discover underappreciated players by using mathematical approaches including Regression models and Data Envelopment Analysis.\nI am also interested in considerations and practices of data ethics. Data policy and ethics will be an increasingly essential part of sports analytics as tracking and sensor data technology continue to develop and be applied to sports analytics. For example, data such as heart rate variability (HRV) measured during the game could be a parameter to help identify overloads for athlete’s fatigue. Distinguishing such pattern could help mitigate fatigue-related injuries for the athletes. However, the process of obtaining such data requires a sufficient data policy and ethical considerations. Data, such as HRV, will increasingly flow into the field of sports analytics at a fast pace. These data can be utilized for athletes for good purposes, such as rehabilitation. But at the same time, this area has the possibility of violating privacy and fairness without sufficient data ethics."
